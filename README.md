Microservices Banking Project
This project is an example of a microservices architecture for a banking application. It incorporates technologies such as NestJS, Kafka, MongoDB, and Node.js. Below, you will find information about the overall structure of the project and details about each microservice.

Technologies
NestJS: A modern, modular Node.js web framework is used.
Kafka: Used for event-driven microservices communication.
MongoDB: Used as the database.
Node.js: Used for fast and efficient execution.
General Information
The project adopts a microservices architecture. Each microservice focuses on its own area of responsibility and communicates with others through Kafka. Brief descriptions of each microservice are provided below:

accounts: Handles operations related to account creation and management.
api-gateway: Receives HTTP requests and directs them to the relevant microservices.
banks: Manages bank and customer-related operations.
transfers: Manages transfer creation and management operations.
